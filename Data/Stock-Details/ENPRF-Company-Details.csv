It operates through two segments, Current Water and Pumptronics. The company provides patented and proprietary technologies for the treatment of wastewater and drinking water that are contaminated by metals or nutrients, such as arsenic and nitrate/ammonia associated with the mining, metal processing, chemical, agricultural, municipal, and waste management sectors; and for the recovery of nickel and other valuable metals from waste mill sulphide tailings associated with the mining sector. Its technologies include electro-static deionization, a electrochemical process that lowers the concentration of total dissolved solids in water; ammonia removal technology, a technology used for the removal of dissolved ammonia from industrial and municipal water, including wastewater, storm water, sewage effluent, and mine waste water; NitrEL system, an electrochemical water treatment process that reduces nitrate concentrations in contaminated drinking water, groundwater, and industrial process wastewater streams; AmdEl, an electrochemical system that prevents the oxidation of sulphide minerals in tailings or waste rock; and ExtrEL for the recovery of metals from sulphide tailings and ore. The company was formerly known as ENPAR Technologies Inc. and changed its name to Current Water Technologies Inc. in January 2018. Current Water Technologies Inc. was incorporated in 1996 and is headquartered in Guelph, Canada.","Dr. Gene S.
