Lenzilumab is an antibody that binds to and neutralizes granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The company is developing lenzilumab as a treatment for cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 for which it has completed a Phase 3 study and is the focus of a Phase 2/3 study sponsored by the NIH. It is also developing lenzilumab, which is also being studied in conjunction with CD19-targeted CAR-T cell therapies, as well as exploring the effectiveness of lenzilumab in other inflammatory conditions, such as acute Graft versus Host Disease in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in eosinophilic asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the company focuses on studying lenzilumab for patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia exhibiting RAS pathway mutations. Its pipeline also includes two other Humaneered monoclonal antibodies, ifabotuzumab, which binds to EphA3, and HGEN005, which targets EMR1. Ifabotuzumab has been evaluated in a Phase 1 study of glioblastoma multiforme that showed tumor specific targeting of all known tumor sites with no normal tissue uptake. HGEN005 is being explored as a treatment for a range of eosinophilic diseases, including eosinophilic leukemia as an optimized naked antibody and as the backbone for a novel CAR-T construct. Humanigen, Inc. was incorporated in 2000 and is headquartered in Short Hills, New Jersey.","Dr. Cameron  Durrant M.D., MBA",Healthcare,US,6,973 200 3100,830 Morris Turnpike,Short Hills,NJ,07078-2625,1.177,4.167,https://financialmodelingprep.com/image-stock/HGEN.png,2013-01-31,False,False,True,False,False
