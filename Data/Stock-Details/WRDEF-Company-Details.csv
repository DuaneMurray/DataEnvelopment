Our centers are places where people go, not only to shop, but also to work, relax and spend time with friends and family. We now own and operate 30 center locations across the Netherlands, Belgium and France  combining leisure, entertainment, health & beauty and food & drink with more traditional retail. We choose centers close to cities  that are well connected to public transport and where we can offer free parking. Our centers are anchored around food retail  each has at least one hypermarket or two to three supermarkets. Our centers are places where people go, not only to shop, but also to meet and relax with friends and family. We take a deliberately long-term approach. Our aim is to deliver attractive returns for our investors, create positive value for local communities and other stakeholders and, over time, increase the value of our investments. As a business, consumers are at the heart of everything we do.",Mr. Matthijs  Storm,Real Estate,NL,93,31 20 702 7800,"WTC Schiphol, Tower A",Schiphol,,1118 BH,,0,https://financialmodelingprep.com/image-stock/WRDEF.png,2013-07-08,True,False,False,False,False
