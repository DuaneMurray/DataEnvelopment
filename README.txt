def O = open;
def H = high;

def Buying = V*(C-L)/(H-L);

BOSratio = Buying / Selling


Price to Earnings


Price-to-Book Ratio:

High Book to Market ratio = value stock
long position in low book-to-market stocks and a short position
in high book-to-market stocks generates significantly abnormal returns

The market-to-book ratio, also called the price-to-book ratio, is the reverse of the book-to-market ratio. Like the book-to-market ratio, it seeks to evaluate whether a company's stock is over or undervalued by comparing the market price of all outstanding shares with the net assets of the company.

A market-to-book ratio above 1 means that the companyâ€™s stock is overvalued. A ratio below 1 indicates that it may be undervalued; the reverse is the case for the book-to-market ratio. Analysts can use either ratio to run a comparison on the book and market value of a firm.
