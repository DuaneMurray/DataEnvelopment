### FINANCIAL RATIOS ###
########################

EBIT = "Earnings Before Interest and Taxes" = Operating Income
Shareholders Equity = Book Value = (Total Assets - Total Liabil­ities)
Market Capitaliztion = Outstanding Share x Stock Price
CFO = Cash From Operating Activities

### LIQUIDITY RATIOS

    Enterprise Value (EV) = Market Capitaliztion + (longTermDebt + shortTermDebt) – cashAndEquivalents

    Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabil­ities

        ratio of current assets and current liabil­ities. It measures the liquidity stand of a firm
        Ideal ratio is 2:1 or more. A low CR, say 0.5:1, means company has Rs.50 for every Rs.100 of debt and can't cover it short-term debts


    Quick Ratio = (Cash + Investments + Receivables) / Current Liabil­ities
        also know as Acid Test Ratio, a measure of short-term solvency of a firm
        Reliable because assets forming part of quick assets are easily conver­tible into cash in short notice. 
        Quick ratio of 1:1 represents satisf­actory financial situation

    Working Capitol = Current Assets - Current Liabil­ities

    Market Value of Company = Number of Outstanding Shares * Share Price

    Book Value of a Company = Total Assets - Total Liabilities


### PROFITABILITY RATIOS

Return on Equity (ROE):     Net Income / (Total Assets - Total Liabil­ities)
Return on Assets (ROA):     Net Income + Interest Expense * (1-tax rate) / Total Assets
Return on Capitol (ROC):    EBIT / Invested Capital
Operating Margin:           EBIT / Net Sales
Net Profit Margin:          Net Income / Net Sales
Earnings per Share (EPS):   Net Income / Number of Outstanding shares

Price Earnings Ratio (P-E): Price of Stock / EPS
Market to Book:             (Number of Outstanding Shares * Price of Stock) / (Total Assets - Total Liabilities)

Trailing 12M Returns (TTM): [(Current Value – Initial Value) / Initial Value]


### SOLVENCY RATIOS

Debt to Assets:                 (longTermDebt + shortTermDebt)  / Total Assets
Debt to Equity:                 (longTermDebt + shortTermDebt) / (Total Assets - Total Liabil­ities)
Book Value per Share (BVPS):    (Total Assets - Total Liabil­ities) / Outstanding shares
Price to Book (P/B):            Stock Price / BVPS
